Introduction
------------

GTK Portal Wrapper is a fork of the old KGtk software that that replaces
kdialogd with calls to libportal. This forces GTK2 and 3 apps with no native
XDG Desktop Portal support to use portals.

TODO
----

- Fix GTK3 file dialogs.
- Add support for filters.
- Add support for custom widgets.
